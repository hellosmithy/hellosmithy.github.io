I'm Ben. I'm a software engineer, but I spend a lot of time thinking about design and product too. I like moving between disciplines. I've been designing and building things professionally for the web since 2004 (and very unprofessionally for much longer) — starting in design and UX and drifting into software engineering.

My family and I just moved back to the UK after three years in Japan, where I was an engineering manager at an AI test automation startup, and latterly was working remotely for my current employer here in the UK. This was actually my second stint living in Japan, having studied there for 2 years over a decade ago. But this time I got to see a side of Japan I missed before — connecting with my wife's family and our local community in a way I could never have done on my own.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); gap: 0.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
  <img src="/images/kids-cherry-blossom.jpg" alt="Cherry blossom" style="border-radius: 0.375rem; width: 100%; height: 200px; object-fit: cover;" />
  <img src="/images/hiking.jpg" alt="Hiking" style="border-radius: 0.375rem; width: 100%; height: 200px; object-fit: cover;" />

</div>

So it's a reboot in a few ways. New country (again). Back to being hands-on after going heavy on management for a while — the [engineer/manager pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) really is a thing it seems. But it also feels like what it means to be an engineer is shifting. AI tooling has changed so much in a short time that the lines between engineering, design and product are blurring. The cross-functional stuff I've always enjoyed suddenly feels less like a nice-to-have and more like the point. It's made making things fun in a way it hasn't been for a while.

This blog is where I'll write about that. Building products, AI, design engineering, and whatever else comes up.
